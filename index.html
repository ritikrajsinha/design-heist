        <p class="muted"  data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-offset="300" data-aos-easing="ease-in-sine" data-aos-duration="800">Competitive markets are competitive for a reason.
            However, because there are so many competing products and so much advertising in those markets that it
            becomes really hard to earn any trust and attention.
            So, how can one stand out?
            This is when you need to understand the concept of market sophistication.
            First written about in Breakthrough Advertising by Eugene Schwartz, market sophistication is basically a
            term that addresses the level of awareness of your marketplace.
            In fact, there are 5 levels of market sophistication. At each level, the market needs to hear specific
            things to believe you.
            So by understanding your market’s sophistication level, you’ll be able to create a message that they’ll
            actually pay attention to and believe in.

        <div class="stage-section">
            <div class="card"  data-aos="zoom-in" data-aos-offset="300" data-aos-easing="ease-in-sine" data-aos-duration="800">
                <img src="resizedImage.png" class="card-img">
                <h3 class="card-head">Stage1:No competition</h3>
                <p class="card-para">It simply means that your product is new enough that it only needs to be placed out
                    there so it can be known by your market.<br><br>Consider the example that you are the only fruit vendor in your market.

   Another example is a computer ad from many years ago. It said, “Personal computer for under $200.” It’s a simple and direct message. It’s not an iPad but back then, a computer for $200 was already a big selling feature.

Just by existing and actively advertising you have great sales!!

But as time progresses more competitors join you.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card"  data-aos="zoom-in" data-aos-offset="300" data-aos-easing="ease-in-sine" data-aos-duration="800">
                <img src="resized.jpg" class="card-img">
                <h3 class="card-head">Stage 2:Time to embrace yourself and increase it</h3>
                <p class="card-para">At this point , you differentiate your products from the rest of your competitors
                    by
                    expanding your original claim.<br><br>Now, not only selling a single fruit you have added a variety of fruits.

Taking the example of Apple again. They are saying every child should have an apple after school. They also say, the Apple computer “is easy to set up and learn, and it comes complete with almost everything you need to start computing in one box including a free easy to use course.”It also has 128K of internal memory and built-in hard drive. Back then, it was a huge deal to have that much memory. That made the Apple as powerful as the average office computer!

At stage two, the descriptions of your product or service are longer, the market is more sophisticated, and you need to explain more than why you’re better than the competition.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card"  data-aos="zoom-in" data-aos-offset="300" data-aos-easing="ease-in-sine" data-aos-duration="800">
                <img src="resizedImage (2).png" class="card-img">
                <h3 class="card-head">Stage 3:The unique mechanism</h3>
                <p class="card-para">At this stage, you’re telling the marketplace more than what you have and why
                    you’re
                    better than the others. You’re explaining how your product or service works. <br><br>Consumers are
                    getting more skeptical by stage three.They’ve become more jaded from exaggerated claims made by the growing group of your competitors, selling pretty much the same thing as you.

To get ahead of the competition, you need to get a new mechanism to make the old promise work. What does that mean?

It means you need to reframe it. You’re saying, “Hey, here’s what we do, here’s how we’re different.” Then you’re adding one piece of information that the customer might not know about what you do, and you tie it back to your claim.

Again taking the example of the fruit vendor. Now you are claiming that your fruits are fresh. You have apples from himachal, oranges from nagpur and so on.

Brands that enter into a saturated market need to already need to be at this level. To get to stage four, you must focus on defeating the competition.</p>

                <h3 class="card-head">Stage 4:Amplify your unique mechanism</h3>
                <p class="card-para">At this stage, it gets more competitive. There are so many choices out there with
                    people doing similar things as you. So now not only do you have to promise more benefits than your
                    competitor, you need yet another mechanism.<br><br>Let’s return to the computer example. At the early stages, when personal computers were getting more competitive, Steve Jobs asked, “What makes it tick and talk?” That was the new mechanism. A computer that freaking talks.

Only one thing was needed to differentiate their computer from everybody else, and that one thing put them in the headlines.

At stage four, they had the Apple versus PC ads. Apple was for the cool guys. They were the cool bunch. At the time, they claimed, “Last year there were more than 114,000 viruses for PCs not for Macs.” It was a direct claim to say they were better.</p>

                <h3 class="card-head">Stage 5:Become Iconic</h3>
                <p class="card-para">The marketplace place knows so much about the industry, they won’t buy into
                    whatever
                    you have to claim or hard sell anymore.This is where you sell on how your
                    brand services only specific types of people and you encourage them to buy into the
                    exclusivity.<br><br>There’s a shift from features to identifying who your customer is, who you
                    serve, and
                    who your product is for.<br><br>When Steve Jobs introduced the first iPhone? “It’s an iPod, it’s a phone, it has the internet.” People were freaked out. They didn’t realize you could have all that in one device.

That’s iconic. The product is totally different and made history.</p>
